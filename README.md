# hello-world
First time using gitHub and I know that I will love it.
The name is Hope Obadan, I am soon to graduate with a bachelors in computer science but I decided to push ahead of my self and learn to program. I wanted to get my feet in the work field before I get done. I focused mostly on javascript because I already have a certification as a Web Developer.
